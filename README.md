🌟 Inspiration

We were inspired to create this project after noticing a real-world accessibility gap. Many visually and hearing-impaired users struggle with real-time communication, and we wanted to change that.

Our idea was to bridge speech and touch — transforming spoken words into tactile Braille feedback using haptics.
The concept of “feeling” language instead of hearing or seeing it motivated us to combine speech recognition and Braille technology into one meaningful, inclusive solution.

🧠 What We Learned

Throughout development, we explored the intersection of accessibility and technology in depth.
We learned about:

🎙️ Speech-to-text processing with Apple’s iOS Speech framework

⠿ Braille encoding systems and real-time character mapping

📱 Haptic feedback integration for tactile communication

🧭 Accessible UI/UX design, focusing on non-visual user interaction

On the technical side, we strengthened our skills in Swift, AVFoundation, and real-time data processing — all while learning how to design with empathy and inclusivity in mind.

🏗️ Building the Project

Our build process followed an iterative and user-centered approach:

Braille Mapping: Programmatically represented each Braille character.

Speech Recognition: Implemented real-time voice-to-text conversion using the iOS Speech framework.

Haptic Integration: Each Braille dot triggers a distinct vibration pattern, allowing users to feel each character through the phone’s vibration motor.

Minimal UI: Designed a clean, intuitive interface that works without relying on sight or sound.

User Testing: Gathered feedback from sample users to refine feedback timing, sensitivity, and accessibility flow.

This combination allows users to literally touch language — experiencing speech as vibration-based Braille in real time.

⚙️ Challenges We Overcame

Creating this system wasn’t simple. Some major challenges included:

⏱️ Maintaining real-time performance — even slight delays disrupt comprehension.

🤲 Designing distinct haptic patterns that feel natural, accurate, and comfortable over long sessions.

🧩 Balancing accessibility with simplicity, ensuring every interaction is intuitive for users with varying sensory abilities.

🔄 User testing required patience, empathy, and constant iteration to meet real accessibility needs.

Through these challenges, we learned that true accessibility design means building with users, not just for them.

👥 Target Users

Our app is designed for individuals across a range of accessibility needs:

🦯 Visually Impaired Users: Who cannot rely on sight to read or view content.

🔇 Hearing Impaired Users: Who need access to spoken information in another modality.

🤝 Deaf-Blind Users: Who benefit most from tactile, real-time feedback through vibration-based Braille.

💡 Vision

Our goal is to make communication more inclusive, instant, and human — turning every smartphone into a bridge between spoken words and tactile understanding.
